In past generations, there was always a trade-off between security, usability and privacy in identity verification systems. SSI for the first time breaks this trade off, enabling business to offer 1-click, compliant, & hyper-secure access to their digital services."},

It constitutes a new way to provide a globally unique identifier to people, organizations or things. Think of it as your personal unique URL. The typical DID syntax is as follows: did:didmethod:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Read more about recent discussions on DIDs here."}

For organizations that do not necessarily need to perform strong authentication of their customers, SSI provides a privacy-by-design Single Sign On and 2FA solutions that helps you comply with GDPR and other data protection laws."},
