    its Bet on GATACA

    are eSSIF-Lab, NGI, and the European Commission related? And, where does GATACA
    fit in?</h1><p>eEssif-Lab, also known as the European Self Sovereign Identity
    Lab, is a project funded by the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020
    Research and Innovation Program under the Next Generation Internet (NGI) Initiative.
    <strong>The goal of eSSIF-Lab is to promote and advance the development and adoption
    of Self Sovereign Identities (SSI) in order to enable more secure electronic transactions.</strong></p><p>The
    eSSIF-Lab program plans to distribute up to 5.6€ M among 62 projects, across 3
    open calls. The projects and open calls will be divdided as follows:</p><ul><li><p><em>One</em><strong><em>
    infrastructure-oriented open call</em></strong><em> targeting 20 technical enhancements
    and extensions of the SSI framework</em></p></li><li><p><em>Two </em><strong><em>business-oriented
    open calls</em></strong><em> targeting 42 SSI business and social innovations
    and applications (</em><a href="https://essif-lab.eu/" title="https://essif-lab.eu/"><em>https://essif-lab.eu/</em></a><em>)</em></p></li></ul><p>The
    business-oriented call, or BOC, has 3 competitive phases for which only the best
    projects will be chosen to move onto the next phase (meaning after each phase,
    the number of participants decreases).</p><h3>Where is GATACA in the process?</h3><p>GATACA
    has surpassed phases 1 &amp; 2, and, due to its exceptional contributions, has
    been selected as one of the 5 best-in-class teams of the business-oriented call
    securing an additional 41K€ in equity-free funding, and adding up to a total of
    106K€. More details on our proposal and achievements in the next section!</p><h2>What
    has been GATACA’s involvement in the eSSIF-Lab business-oriented call (BOC)?</h2><p>GATACA’s
    proposal for the eSSIF-Lab BOC was to open the APIs of GATACA Connect, our Verifier’s
    component, in an effort to enable any technology provider to integrate their stack
    with our Connect and exploit its credential verification features for their own
    use cases.</p><p>Let us provide a bit of background. Currently, there is a lack
    of standardization in protocols between the ID Wallets and Verifier components,
    and as a result each provider is building their own protocol. If this continues,
    Verifiers may suffer vendor lock-in situations and ID Wallet holders may need
    to hold multiple wallets, a situation we wish to avoid.</p><p>Thus,<strong> the
    ultimate goal of our initial proposal was to prevent vendor lock-in situations
    starting with our Verifier’s component GATACA Connect.</strong></p><p>So far,
    GATACA’s achievements include a <strong>Connect OpenAPIs Sandbox</strong>, which
    consists of a web application that presents our APIs and offers an interactive,
    visual and simple step-by-step process to integrate and test these APIs. The sandbox
    platform is publicly available at <a href="https://openapis.demo.gataca.io" title="https://openapis.demo.gataca.io">https://openapis.demo.gataca.io</a>.</p><p>Planning
    for Phase 3 includes business case validation with organizations engaged during
    Phase 2.</p><p>Our previous project’s success has us eager to contribute more.
    We want to go one step further with our interoperability commitment by making
    GATACA Connect wallet-agnostic and vendor-agnostic. How, you may ask? Keep on
    reading.</p><p><strong>Hint</strong>: We´ve been selected for the eSSIF-Lab infrastructure-oriented
    call.</p><h2>What about the eSSIF-Lab infrastructure-oriented call (IOC)?</h2><p>That’s
    right! <strong>GATACA has also been chosen within the infrastructure-oriented
    call to develop standards for the SSI Community with 155K€ equity-free funding.</strong>
    In the past couple of months, we began developing a brief outline of how we plan
    to achieve the aforementioned global interoperability. Next we describe our progress.</p><p>Up
    until now, we have opened our own APIs. Now we want to achieve consensus within
    the SSI community and standardize those APIs. We have already analyzed existing
    interoperability efforts and detected some improvement areas. We’ve concluded
    that certain business requirements were not fully considered in some relevant
    standardization efforts, and additionally discovered relevant standardization
    gaps, and found interesting evolved approaches. From there, we decided to go an
    extra mile and document an enhanced version for our APIs, <strong>a draft proposal
    that combined the most interesting perspectives from existing standardization
    &amp; interoperability efforts and our own APIs.</strong></p><p>This unofficial
    draft can be found here: <a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/verifier-apis/"
    title="https://gataca-io.github.io/verifier-apis/">https://gataca-io.github.io/verifier-apis/</a></p><p>The
    draft then became the ground work and inspiration to launch the Verifier Universal
    Interface (VUI) interoperability initiative, an interoperability working group
    that aims at building a complete set of standard APIs for a Verifier component.</p><h2>What’s
    next for GATACA and eSSIF-Lab?</h2><p>The kick-off meeting for eSSIF-Lab IOC will
    take place on April 7th, however we have already initiated collaboration with
    relevant players in the space to continue the development of VUI. <br><br>Stay
    tuned for updates!</p>'
