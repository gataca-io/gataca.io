**On the 14th of December 2022, the European Commission announced the results of the EU Digital Identity Wallet Large Scale Pilots. Gataca will participate as part of the** [**Digital Credentials for Europe (DC4EU)**](https://www.dc4eu.eu/ "https://www.dc4eu.eu/") **consortium, formed by 82 organizations from 23 countries.**

The EUDI Wallet is part of the proposed eIDAS2 regulation, which will provide all European citizens access to a trusted digital identity provided by their government and accepted in all EU Member States and EFTA. It is, therefore, important for the EUDI Wallet to operate within an ecosystem of supporting organizations, issuing attributes, and facilitating sharing of credentials.

The European Commission has designed a program through Large Scale Projects Pilots (LSPs) to develop this ecosystem. International consortia representing a wide variety of organizations from many different European Member States will lead these LSPs.

The DC4EU consortium that Gataca is part of focuses on using the EU Digital Identity Wallet for three specific use cases: **Identity, Social Security, and Education use cases.**

At Gataca, we are experts in decentralized identity and have extended experience in national digital identity and education use cases, having worked previously with the European Commission in the [Early Adopters Program ](https://gataca.io/blog/gataca-joins-the-european-commission-s-early-adopters-program-as-the-ssi-technology-provider-in-the-spanish-group "https://gataca.io/blog/gataca-joins-the-european-commission-s-early-adopters-program-as-the-ssi-technology-provider-in-the-spanish-group")and pioneering the development of a [European Self-Sovereign Identity framework](https://gataca.io/blog/ngi-essif-lab-a-program-funded-by-the-european-commission-doubles-down-its-bet-on-gataca "https://gataca.io/blog/ngi-essif-lab-a-program-funded-by-the-european-commission-doubles-down-its-bet-on-gataca").
