Since our creation, Gataca has been committed to providing our clients with secure and privacy-preserving solutions that restore trust in today’s digital world. Our comprehensive decentralized identity solution is the result of this commitment.

We recognize that building Self-Sovereign Identity technology takes time. This is why, as we received requests from organizations to leverage our technology and satisfy end-users growing concerns about privacy and data control, we decided to create our **partnership program**.

This initiative allows us to identify synergies and opportunities with other like-minded organizations to expand the benefits of decentralized identity to a larger base of business entities.

We are excited to announce our strategic partnership with [Cappelen Bulgaria](https://www.cappelen-group.com/en/ID-security.htm), a leading worldwide manufacturer of security materials and technologies. 
Cappelen is a well-established Bulgarian company in the security papers and documents space with a proven track record of providing secure and reliable solutions to its customers, including its collaboration with the Bulgarian ID Project.

By partnering with Gataca, Cappelen can offer its customers an even more extensive range of identity security solutions while being backed by the most mature SSI technology provider. Our team brings decentralized identity technical, commercial, and regulatory expertise to the table to ensure the best experience for our partners is delivered.

On the flip side, Cappelen’s expertise and reach will help us bring Gataca’s solutions to even more individuals and organizations while sharing the same vision toward secure and trustworthy digital identities.

> By combining Gataca's expertise in Self-Sovereign Identity technology with Cappelen's knowledge of identity security for governments and corporations documentation in Bulgaria, we are confident that this partnership will be fruitful and provide a solution to the growing need for a more secure and private identity management in the digital age \
