For GATACA’s October Ask the Expert series, we hosted a live webinar with Sebastian Manhart, advisor on Digital Identity to the German Chancellery, to discuss Germany’s cross border digital identity strategy. 

## Background: Germany’s SSI-based Digital Identity Vision

In the past year, Germany has made it their priority to bring digital identities based on SSI principles to their citizens. Their vision is simple, in the words of Sebastian Manhart, “a future in which citizens are able to access any private or public service from a user controlled ID wallet on their smartphone, where nobody controls their digital identity.”

Led at a federal government level, Germany’s digital identity initiative includes 4 main sectors--Banking, Telecommunications, e-Commerce, and Mobility, with one representative for each sector. In just 6 months, the nation has implemented their first pilot featuring the digital hotel check-in use case, chosen due to its highly regulated nature. 

But Germany’s vision goes beyond its borders: they initiated individual agreements with multiple nations including Spain, Finland, and the Netherlands, with the goal of developing interoperable, cross-border decentralized digital identity ecosystems and use cases.

## Interview focus: Blockchain, Interoperability & ID Wallets

During our quick chat with Sebastian, we focused on the details and motivations behind Germany’s recent movements, particularly on their underlying technology of choice, partnerships, Wallet marketplace/commercialization strategy, and the interplay with European initiatives such as EBSI, ESSIF and the[ updated eIDAS regulation](https://gataca.io/insights/here-s-what-the-new-eidas-proposal-really-means-for-the-ssi-community-in-6-key-points).

**Key points covered:**

* How were the 4 participating private sectors and their relative representatives chosen?
* What DLT is being used as their underlying technology for the pilot? Why?
* Why were unilateral agreements chosen with other European nations rather than group collaborations?
* What is the interplay between Germany’s efforts and the efforts led at a European Commission level by[ EBSI/ESSIF](https://gataca.io/insights/gataca-helps-ebsi-define-a-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework)?
* Regarding the digital ID wallet market, what eIDAS wallet approach did Germany choose? Will they develop government-issued wallets?
