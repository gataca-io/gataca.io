I got GATACAed. Let’s talk about that.

Step 1: I met an awesome, focused, and ambitious leader and her team. They were serious, but also very willing to tell you they were bored with what you were saying. I liked that. I joined them.

Step 2: I always thought of identity as who I am and how the world sees me. But I had no idea about the complexities of _digital_ identity. Even after countless data breaches, I still didn’t care. Cue enlightenment process.

Step 3: I was suddenly conscious of how many forms I had to fill out. Every. Single. Day. Why exactly did they need my information to access a digital service? Why did I have to share the same information, over and over again?

Step 4: I knew exactly where my passport and social security card were stored. But I had no idea which companies had my digital versions. Why was I so chilled giving away my most sensitive information? If my information is stored, then everyone’s information is probably there. That’s a very attractive goldmine for hackers. According to a privacy app I now use, my sensitive data has been breached 21 times and is available on the dark web.

Step 5: So, I have been wasting my time filling out numerous forms and submitting them to companies who are struggling to keep up with cyberattacks. We can’t imagine our lives without digital tools or the internet, but is there a better way?

Step 6: Gataca sells technology. But there is something profound about the way the team thinks. Not just in terms of decentralized digital identity to help our digital lives be better and more secure. There’s a huge ambition to rethink the way we do things. That’s the kind of team you want to be working with as an employee, client, or partner. It’s challenging and a wild ride.

Get GATACAed.
