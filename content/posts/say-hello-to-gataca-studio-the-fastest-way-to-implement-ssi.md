With the approval of[ eIDAS 2.0 ](https://gataca.io/blog/here-s-what-the-new-eidas-proposal-really-means-for-the-ssi-community-in-6-key-points)approaching sooner than expected, European organizations are struggling to transition into a user-centric digital identity system based on credentials and [wallets](https://gataca.io/blog/ssi-essentials-a-crash-course-on-digital-id-wallets).

[Self-Sovereign Identity](https://gataca.io/blog/ssi-essentials-everything-you-need-to-know-about-decentralized-identity) technology (SSI) is one of the few compliant digital identity systems with user-centricity & privacy at its foundation that is readily available for organizations to adopt. Yet, why aren't they flocking to try it out?

So far, the implementation of SSI technology has entailed a cumbersome process with a steep learning curve. SSI providers traditionally have only offered on-premise or open-source solutions with complex workflows requiring many hours of consultation and expert deployment guidance, creating a massive barrier to adoption.
