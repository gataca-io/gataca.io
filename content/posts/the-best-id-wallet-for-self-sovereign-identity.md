Ok, we are totally biased. But it's not just us who think the same.

We are so proud of our technology, that we wanted to share our excitement with you and give you a taste of what we've built. Watch the short video below to see what we are talking about.

Can you also feel the rhythm? It's amazing!

Our SSI technology platform for decentralized identity and access management has now reached a strong level of maturity and we're ready to take off. During the last three years, we've built a comprehensive set of products:

* GATACA Wallet: a digital ID wallet for consumers
* GATACA Certify: tools for Trusted Authorities to issue W3C-compliant verifiable credentials
* GATACA Connect: single-sign-on authentication tools for businesses to accept decentralized digital IDs for authentication.

We were born with a strong sense of global interoperability, so we designed our technology to be blockchain-agnostic. Wait, what? Don't worry, all that matters is that we can integrate our technology with any government', industry consortium' or business organization's  infrastructure. All so that you can enjoy secure and fast onboarding and authentication services.

We are now working on building open APIs to enable a greater level of interoperability. We'll keep you posted.
