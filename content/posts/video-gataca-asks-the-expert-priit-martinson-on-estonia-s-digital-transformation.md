Imagine living in the most digital country in the world.

For our June Ask the Expert series, we give you a sneak peak into a day in the life of these lucky citizens. What country are we referring to?

Named the most advanced digital society in the world, [**Estonia**](https://e-estonia.com/ "https://e-estonia.com/") **enables its citizens to do almost anything online from taxes, to healthcare, to legal processes.** It was the first Nation-State in the world to deploy blockchain technology in production systems back in 2012, and as of today, 99% of their public services are available as e-services. According to Forbes, Estonia is the World’s Most Digital Country. How did they get there? Was their Digital ID system the linchpin of this digitalization?

To answer these questions we invited **Priit Martinson** onto the stage. Priit led the Government Technology & Digital Transformation practice of PwC Estonia, delivering Estonia’s e-government solutions and advising foreign nations on how to transform their public services.

**Our conversation with Priit not only provides a clear lens into the lives of Estonian citizens, but also insight into the efforts it took to get where they are today.** Below are the topics we discussed and their relevant timepoints in the video:

* **(10:08)** What were the most challenging aspects of implementing or deploying this digital identity system in Estonia?
* **(13:39)** One of the claims to incentivize citizens to join the eID system was taxes. Another helpful factor was the fact that Estonia’s population is quite young. What are your insights on these two ideas?

* **(19:05)** Regarding Estonia’s Privacy by Transparency mindset. How was privacy solved?
