In recent months, the GATACA team has been hard at work on an exciting new product: **Gataca Studio, our cloud platform designed for businesses of all sizes who wish to implement full-stack SSI tech with little integration effort.**

Catering to our client’s needs, traditionally, our products have been solely offered in on-premise modality, which was essential to comply with SSI technology early adopters' requirements, composed mainly of large public institutions such as government administrations and universities. The main challenge with on-premise deployments is inefficiency. Those clients required on-premise offerings for production environments, but wanted to quickly learn and evaluate SSI technology by conducting smaller-scale pilots first. On-premise deployments for piloting SSI make little sense, as they require substantial dedication of resources and longer implementation times, posing avoidable barriers to demonstrating SSI benefits.

Furthermore, as SSI is becoming noticeable in a larger number of industries (traditional banking, fintech and DeFi, healthcare and transportation) with newer and/or smaller companies strongly betting on public and private clouds for their infrastructure strategy, it became apparent that Gataca Studio would be the preferred choice for companies in the private sector.

As the innovation of SSI technologies continued to accelerate, **we realized there was a way for our product to guarantee the same level of government-grade security and privacy provided by an on-premise deployment whilst boosting customer flexibility and user experience through SaaS infrastructure.** So, the GATACA team got to work.

Now, we’re just weeks away from launching Gataca Studio, the low-code SSI solution enabling compliant identity verification in seconds – the quickest way to implement SSI, no matter the size or budget of the business. As with an AWS subscription, organizations will be able to conveniently contract and start using our solution with all its original features (& more!) in just a few clicks. For clients, the platform’s intuitive, user-friendly interface and W3C standard-compliant core:

* **Enables instant & reusable KYC** through [passwordless authentication](https://gataca.io/blog/passwordless-the-model.ssi-the-method/ "https://gataca.io/blog/passwordless-the-model.ssi-the-method/") and strategic partnership integrations
* **Streamlines the issuance and verification of** [**verifiable credentials**](https://gataca.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-ssi-101-decentralized-identifiers-dids-verifiable-credentials-vcs "https://gataca.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-ssi-101-decentralized-identifiers-dids-verifiable-credentials-vcs"), as well as the management of users in one place
* **Is fully integrated with the EBSI**, European blockchain network, infrastructure while maintaining its blockchain agnostic capabilities

Through these features, Gataca Studio will become **the bridge between potential clients and businesses**. Instant & reusable KYC will provide instant conversion rates, unlocking higher revenues, longer customer LTV, and attracting new customers. Secure SSI authentication is not limited to onboarding processes, it can also be easily added to in-app activities and purchases to eliminate the possibility of fake transactions, giving end-users confidence, businesses peace of mind, without compromising usability. This is thanks to the government-grade security and GDPR compliance engrained in Gataca Studio-powered transactions which significantly reduce identity fraud, a growing concern in our increasingly digital lives.

Zooming in on the back-end features, the fact that the platform’s backbone is fully integrated with EBSI but simultaneously has the **capacity to integrate with any blockchain network**, allows organizations to offer homogeneous, compliant cross-border service offering in Europe, while still having the chance to interact and link with their ledger of choice.

In essence, Gataca Studio has the potential to superpower any digital platform in all its identity processes, the most important link between users and businesses.

> “We’re thrilled to be so close to the launch date. Offering SSI technology in a cloud-based, subscription version has been our team’s vision for quite some time - we truly believe it is the easiest way for organizations of all sizes to experience the benefits of SSI technology, bringing us one step closer to wider adoption.”  
> **Irene Hernandez, CEO**

We will be officially launching in October, but we already have strategic partners successfully testing out the technology.
