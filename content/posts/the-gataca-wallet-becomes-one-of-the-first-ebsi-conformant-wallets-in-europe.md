* Towards the end of 2021, the EBSI team at the European Commission launched its [EBSI Wallet Conformance Test](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Become+conformant "https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Become+conformant") (WCT) to certify conformance with EBSI specs third-party SSI providers.
* Our [GATACA Wallet](https://gataca.io/products/wallet "https://gataca.io/products/wallet") has successfully passed the WTC, becoming one of the first EBSI conformant Wallets in the region.

## What is the EBSI Wallet Conformance Test?

[EBSI ](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/ebsi "https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/ebsi")(European Blockchain Services Infrastructure), also referred to as the European blockchain network, has been developing specifications to promote interoperability with its network and its services. The first set of public specifications was directed toward ID wallet applications to ensure conformance to EBSI core service APIs.

The EBSI WCT consists of 3 test scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario 1: ONBOARD | That a user can successfully on-board on EBSI through the Wallet |
| Scenario 2: ISSUE | That a user can request a credential from an Issuer and download it to the Wallet |
| Scenario 3: VERIFY | That a user can present a credential to a Verifier |

The EBSI WCT is simple & financially accessible. This is especially helpful as Wallet providers must go through the WCT each time a new major version of their app is released. The main benefits of being an EBSI conformant wallet include:

* Access to a large, connected ecosystem
* Participation & interoperability with European cross-border services
* Visibility & credibility with European players

## What does it mean for GATACA?

Since mid-2020, GATACA has been closely involved with the EBSI project, using EBSI’s DID registry, credential data models, APIs, and Trusted Issuer Registry (TIR).

We furthered our involvement by becoming [a primary SSI technology provider for the Spanish group and later in the European Commission’s Early Adopters Program](https://gataca.io/blog/gataca-joins-the-european-commission-s-early-adopters-program-as-the-ssi-technology-provider-in-the-spanish-group "https://gataca.io/blog/gataca-joins-the-european-commission-s-early-adopters-program-as-the-ssi-technology-provider-in-the-spanish-group"), whose goal is to support pioneering countries' test use cases over EBSI. Later in 2021, we became a technology provider for 2 additional Early Adopters projects.

With the EBSI Wallet Conformance certification, GATACA’s market positioning and opportunities are boosted. As one of the few certified Wallets in the market, GATACA has become a key reference and qualified provider for organizations interested in integrating their services with EBSI. 

## What’s next?

The WCT is just the first of many specifications that the European Commission and other regional standardization and regulatory bodies will develop. The current WCT will evolve and mature to include new specifications for ecosystem stakeholders (issuers, users, and verifiers).

GATACA will continue to work closely with EBSI and pioneering European nations to pilot SSI use cases and soon bring these to life in production environments, which is expected to occur later this year. We believe it is essential to comply and evolve with the EBSI regulation to maintain interoperability and compatibility with both the public and private sectors as they begin to integrate blockchain use cases in their processes.
