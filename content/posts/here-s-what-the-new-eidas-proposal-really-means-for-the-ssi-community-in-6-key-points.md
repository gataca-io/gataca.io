* SSI principles are all over the new eIDAS proposal, yet its technology agnostic nature shreds doubts as to wether ESSIF, the European SSI framework developed under the European Commission’s EBSI Program, will become the technology framework of choice for governments.
* A more thorough analysis of the proposal evidences both opportunities and threats for the SSI community.
* We’ve analyzed 6 critical points and provided an impact assessment.

> _“Every time an App or website asks us to create a new digital identity or to easily log on via a big platform, we have no idea what happens to our data in reality. That is why the Commission will soon propose a secure European e-identity. One that we trust and that any citizen can use anywhere in Europe to do anything from paying your taxes to renting a bicycle. A technology where we can control ourselves what data and how data is used.”_

> **Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, in her State of the Union address, 16 September 2020.**

On June 6th, 2021, the European Commission announced the launch of a European Digital Identity together with an improvement proposal to the current eIDAS regulation in response to the announcement made by the President of the European Commission the previous year. Check out [Adrian Doerk](https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/digital-identity-wallet-a-place-for-your-self-sovereign-identity-5dfbd3d48a74 "https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/digital-identity-wallet-a-place-for-your-self-sovereign-identity-5dfbd3d48a74")’s clear & concise summary of the proposal and introduction into the new #EUDigitalIdentity wallet - also referred to as EU Wallet from now on.

To summarize Adrian’s article: the new proposal brings EU Digital identities one step closer to self-sovereign identity principles. In the new proposal, not only will all Member States be _obliged_ to provide certified digital wallets to citizens, but businesses will also have to accept them as forms of identification, opening up the applications of government-issued digital identities to the private sector. **In this article, GATACA dives a bit deeper into the new eIDAS revision and explores the potential opportunities and/or threats this proposal may bring to the SSI community.**

Now, let’s get into the specifics. While we can all agree that the proposed revisions brings hopes to the development and adoption of SSI in Europe, one where citizens can control how their data is being used, it is important to take a step back and analyze its potential effects, both positive and negative, on the wider SSI community which include SSI technology providers, businesses, providers of electronic attestations of attributes (that is, issuers of verifiable credentials), and citizens, in an effort to bring the complex technicalities of the amendment into a market-focused setting.

Below, we’ve outlined 6 critical points extracted from the eIDAS amendment and provided an impact assessment for each of them.

_Please note, the new eIDAS regulation proposal is currenlty under revision by Member States and is subject to change._

## **Key point #1**: All EU Member States must provide a digital wallet to its citizens

**Where**: Article 6a

> “The draft Regulation requires Member States in Article 6a to issue a European Digital Identity Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act \[…\]
>
> European Digital Identity Wallets shall be issued:
>
> (a) by a Member State;
>
> (b) under a mandate from a Member State;
>
> (c) independently but recognised by a Member State."

A Member State could therefore choose one of three paths: to provide their own Wallet, either via (a) an in-house development or (b) mandating the task to a specific (public or private) Wallet provider, or (c) creating an open market for private Wallet providers and certify a number of solutions.

**Opportunity.** Shall the Member State choose option (c), it would effectively open up the Wallet provider market to all types of high quality providers, and close it up to those who do not offer the required security or quality. This is turn would trigger competition between wallets from both specialized technology companies and big tech companies. Increasing the competitiveness in the marketplace benefits users, as wallet providers must compete for the best user experience, privacy and security features. Option (c) would be the best one to stimulate the nascent market of existing SSI wallet providers worldwide, who have been leading so far the development of tools and contributing to the definition of standards and technology frameworks.

**Threats**. **Opting for path (a)** would cut down market expectations. The threat exists should governments focus efforts and invest heavily on promoting their own wallet, leaving little space for citizen agency. Investors would no longer be willing to bet on SSI Technology providers and eventually a very rich, active, and global community of innovators would be forced to find opportunities somewhere else.

This scenario also raises a critical concern. If the SSI community, which is strongly focusing efforts on interoperability, is substituted by government-led national initiatives, that likely will protect local interests during the design phase, how can we ensure interoperability beyond the confinements of Europe, and even among Member States? Interoperability is a long-term bet, one that the SSI community has been working on for over 4 years now (much more if we consider ground work), and it’s still in its early stages. How can we expect to achieve interoperability when Member States shall deploy their solutions in under 12 months from the adoption of the new Regulation? In this case, we could expect that the mandatory mutual recognition would be met via more complicated technology frameworks (as opposed to standards-based interoperability) and, as we learned from the current eIDAS implementation, this approach does not lead to massive adoption.

**Option (b)**, which apparently offers middle ground, has its disadvantages too. Under the best scenario for SSI Wallet providers, in which Member State decide or need to conduct the mandate through a public tender process and not by assigning it to a hand-picked organization, it is only logical to think that only larger companies with resources - and contacts - will be able to win these public contracts.

Lastly, **option (c)**. While most participants in the SSI community would point this option as their preferred choice, is does not come without risks for them. In this scenario, specialized providers (i.e. all SSI technology startups) will still have to earn the “EU Digital Identity Wallet Trust Mark”, which is great and necessary. However, if this process is designed in such a way that is not easily accessible (cost and resource-wise) to these small, innovative technology companies, we may as well be handing over this market to the large online platforms the Regulation is trying to defend citizens from in the first place.

## Key point #2: The creation and verification of verifiable credentials (referred as electronic attestations of attributes in the Regulation), and the registry of electronic data in a DLT are now regulated Trust Services.

**Where**: Article 3, Point 16.

> "‘trust service’ means an electronic service normally provided against payment which consists of:
>
> (a) the creation, verification, and validation of \[…\] electronic attestation of attributes and certificates related to those services; \[…\]
>
> (f) the recording of electronic data into an electronic ledger.’;"

**Opportunities**. Categorizing these services as Trust Services incentivizes Issuers from both the public and private sector to generate Credentials following a common regulatory and technical framework and to leverage blockchain technologies. This sets up the required regulatory framework by infusing trust in the market for the use of Verifiable Credentials and blockchain networks, as these can **no longer be denied legal effect on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic attestation of attributes or for qualified electronic ledgers.**

Moreover, the regulation of blockchain networks and their use for the recording of electronic data with legal effect is a giant leap towards the proliferation of production-ready use cases as opposed to pilots and press-oriented projects.

To Europeans, this means that EBSI, the european blockchain network led by the European Commission, just got a legal framework to become THE blockchain for public services.

**Threats**. Every coin has two sides. If one creates a blockchain network on their own and registers data on it, will this data have legal validity? Not necessarily, but it definitely cannot be denied legal effect for the fact that it is in a proprietary blockchain network. The proposal therefore opens up the opportunity for non qualified credentials issued by an ill-intentioned organization linked to registered data on a non qualified private blockchain controlled by that same organization to have a legal framework - an excuse - to demand legal effect in court. Or at least to have a longer, more complex procedure. Having too many agents, without qualifications, be able to perform such activities will create room for unruly autonomy.

Another aspect worth highlighting is the decoupling of the EU Wallet from the issuance of verifiable credentials. One may conclude from the Regulation that Verifiable Credentials could be issued by any Trust Service provider, including non qualified providers, but that such provider does not necessarily have to make these credentials compatible with EU Wallets. As a result, we could imagine organizations from both the private and public sector willing to keep some kind of control over issued credentials and make them only available via their own Apps or Websites. This would indeed hinder the potential of EU Wallets to become the single, user-controlled repository of all our personal information (which is one of its primary purposes). The EU Wallet and issuance of electronic attestations is also decoupled from the blockchain trust service, throwing strong uncertainty as to whether EBSI and ESSIF are intended to become the technological framework for the European Digital Identity.

## **Key point #3:** The wallet will be allowed for use in the private sector, and will be mandatory for private relying parties providing services where strong user authentication for online identification is required (including large online platforms).

Where: Article 12b

> "Where private relying parties providing services are required by national or Union law, to use strong user authentication for online identification, or where strong user authentication is required by contractual obligation, **including in the areas of transport, energy, banking and financial services, social security, health, drinking water, postal services, digital infrastructure, education or telecommunications**, private relying parties shall also accept the use of European Digital Identity Wallets issued in accordance with Article 6a.
>
> Where very large online platforms as defined in Regulation \[reference DSA Regulation\] Article 25.1. require users to authenticate to access online services, they shall also accept the use of European Digital Identity Wallets issued in accordance with Article 6a strictly upon voluntary request of the user and in respect of the minimum attributes necessary for the specific online service for which authentication is requested, such as proof of age."

**Opportunity:** Adoption is all that matters. We could design the most secure, privacy-preserving, user friendly identity framework, but if it can only be used in limited cases, it will be a good-for-nothing Regulation. One of the key success factors for Estonia’s eID system (watch our Ask The Expert series on the subject [here](https://gataca.io/insights/video-gataca-asks-the-expert-priit-martinson-on-estonia-s-digital-transformation "https://gataca.io/insights/video-gataca-asks-the-expert-priit-martinson-on-estonia-s-digital-transformation")) was the involvement of the private sector early on, particularly the banking industry. Making the EU Wallets not only mandatory for Member States to provide, but also for critical industries in the private sector to accept, is certainly one of the greatest hopes for its success. This provision is of particular interest to SSI providers, as it **guarantees a market.** All these industries, including companies like Google, Amazon, or Facebook, will be forced to accept the use of EU Wallets for authentication and may also seize an opportunity to offer the issuance of Credentials as a new revenue stream. For those purposes, they’ll demand technology and/or services currently provided by specialized SSI companies, potentially leading to mergers and acquisitions, and a clearer exit strategy for investors.

## **Key point #4:** The possibility for European countries to accept Credentials from abroad, even from non-EU countries, without the need for peer agreements.

**Where**: Article 12c, 14, 24

> "Article 12c. “Where electronic identification \[…\] is required under national law or by administrative practice to access an online service provided by a public sector body in a Member State, the electronic identification means, issued in another Member State shall be recognised in the first Member State for the purposes of cross-border authentication for that online service, provided that the following conditions are met \[…\]”
>
> Article 14 - “\[…\] trust services provided by providers established in the third country concerned shall be considered equivalent to qualified trust services provided by qualified trust service providers established in the Union.’;
>
> “The provisions on the use of remote means of identification have been harmonised and clarified in order to ensure that the same rules are applied across the EU” as amended in Article 24.

**Opportunities**. Member States no longer need to establish a lengthy bilateral process to enable mutual recognition between two or more countries, which was one of the main stoppers for broad eIDAS adoption in cross-border use cases. With the new provisions, **a certified wallet and qualified Trust Services for electronic attestations will be enough for a Member State to accept identity attributes from abroad, including non-EU countries**, as long as the necessary assurance levels for electronic identification (substantial or high required) are met.

Furthermore, the ways in which remote identification can be executed have been harmonized breaking the national silos that made cross-border interoperability a technological nightmare.

What does this mean for the SSI community? Easier interoperability and an even broader market. SSI technology providers will not need to build complex, ad-hoc solutions, for each country, but to focus on compliance with the regulation that opens its solution for all Member States at once. Of course, reality is not always so simple, but this provision certainly lifts hopes for faster adoption and de-risks SSI technology providers, as they are no longer limited to market opportunities in their country of origin.

**Threats**. Bigger market opportunities come with bigger competition. These provisions open the opportunity to better-funded US-based companies to enter the European market. Will the EU entrepreneurship & innovation ecosystem survive in their own playing field? Advanced non-EU wallet tech providers may enter EU market sooner than foreseen, specially if SSI regulations in their home countries are lagging.

A brighter view of this issue could benefit EU wallet providers should regulation in non-EU countries prosper soon. If EU wallet providers, unlike non-EU wallet providers, are born requiring to be issued under a notified electronic identification scheme of level of assurance ‘high’, EU wallet providers could hold a competitive advantage in non-EU countries, as both users and service providers will most likely have a preference towards wallets with higher levels of trustworthiness and assurance.

## **Key point #5:** All wallets must technically enable selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties

**Where**: Point (29)

> “The European Digital Identity Wallet should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. This feature should become a basic design feature thereby reinforcing convenience and personal data protection including minimisation of processing of personal data.”

**Opportunities.** Selective disclosure is a core design principle for SSI and reflects the influence that SSI frameworks had over the new Proposal. The great news is that this provision strengthens the arguments in favor of selecting ESSIF as a technical framework of this Regulation, which could in fact have a positive impact on the broader SSI community.

**Threats**. Although there is already a Community group [draft report on Data Minimization published in the W3C](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-minimization/ "https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-minimization/"), there are not yet standard approaches or specifications for its technical implementation, neither within the proposed Regulation, nor within the SSI community at large.

An elegant and efficient way to implement selective disclosure is with the use of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) combined with multi-claim credentials, provided we found a way to reduce its computationally expensive nature and the complexity of its implementation and algorithmic review. However, there is no policy framework that supports ZKP, which makes it not a legally-binding proof for identity verification. As such, today SSI providers with a strong focus on legal compliance are either not supporting selective disclosure mechanisms or implementing mono-claim credentials, as is the case of GATACA in an attempt to offer a temporary solution, in exchange of higher complexity at UX design level.

Most worrying is the fact that the lack of specifications for the implementation of selective disclosure mechanisms has led the SSI industry to offer multiple solutions that are not compatible among themselves. Unless the Regulation comes with clear and concise specifications for this aspect, we risk the achievement of interoperability at international level.

## **Key point #6:** Wallets must enable the storage of qualified and non qualified credentials, and allow signatures with Qualified Electronic Signature.

**Where**: Article 6a (b)

> “European Digital Identity Wallets shall enable the user to:
>
> (a) securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal person identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline in order to use online public and private services;
>
> (b) sign by means of qualified electronic signatures.sign by means of qualified electronic signatures.”

**Opportunities.** So far the SSI industry has merely focused on the first point, developing standards and technology for the creation, verification, and storage of Verifiable Credentials. The added compulsory feature of qualified electronic signatures accelerates the provisioning of value added services and the usefulness of wallets in daily activities, such as the signature of documents. This in turn simplifies the life of citizens that cannot currently rely on electronic signature for many legal procedures in their jurisdiction.

It also broadens the concept of ID Wallet to more than a personal data vault; it glimpses the intentions to create a powerful tool, a single personal key for the Internet. As such, the logical evolutionary step would be to expand the wallet features to the storage and management of digital money, which may include or not cryptocurrencies, therefore creating very attractive diversification opportunities to wallet providers.

**Threats**. Jack of all trades, master of none. Biting off more than one can chew is an alarming signal of failure. Starting off an identity solution with more features than strictly necessary only increases complexity in an already complex endeavor. The need to include qualified electronic signatures in order to offer a certified EU Wallet will likely trigger mergers and partnerships between e-signature tech and ID wallet providers, but will also delay the release of market-ready products.

We could go on with our impact assessment, but the one thing is clear: the new proposal has pumped up the SSI community’s spirits as the market’s uncertainty veil seems to be disappearing. There is truly no doubt that the new EU Digital Identity will have a tremendous positive impact on the European and global economy. It is estimated that the development and implementation of the revised eIDAS proposal, including the new European Digital Identity, will cost Europe around 3.2€ billion, however the benefits could reach 9.6€ billion with an addition of 5K-27K jobs.tsx. Of course the benefits also extend to citizens who will have their day to day lives facilitated.

The proposal has just been submitted for revision and approval, so we still have long ways to go before mass adoption is achieved in the region. Nonetheless, the announcement by Vice President Margrethe Vestager and Commissioner Thierry Breton was a giant leap towards the digital self sovereignty of European citizens. What are your thoughts?
