…And we’re back!

We know it's been a while but we’re glad to announce that we have re-launched Ask the Expert! Our goal with this initiative is to **keep our users updated on the latest trends in the digital identity and blockchain space,** so we invite relevant stakeholders in the industry for a quick, casual conversation on a trending topic.

For our April 2021 series, we’ve invited Kaliya Young, widely known as the Identity Woman, as our expert of honor to discuss the ever-important topic of COVID-19 health passes.

Kaliya is an internationally recognized expert in the self-sovereign identity and blockchain space and has been involved in this industry since 2005. In addition to being the co-chair of the Interop Working Group for the[ Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/ "https://identity.foundation/") (DIF), she’s currently the ecosystems director for the [Covid Credentials Initiative ](https://www.covidcreds.org/ "https://www.covidcreds.org/")(CCI).

In this interview, we not only **discuss the role and goal of initiatives such as the CCI and** [**Good Health Pass Collaborative**](https://www.goodhealthpass.org/ "https://www.goodhealthpass.org/")**, but we also briefly touch upon the challenges surrounding these projects including interoperability issues and privacy concerns**. Below we provide a sneak peek into Kaliya’s response to our questions, however if you wish to view the full video at once, scroll to the bottom of the post!
