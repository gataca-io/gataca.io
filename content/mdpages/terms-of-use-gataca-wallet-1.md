### 1. INTRODUCTION

Gataca España S.L.U., a Spanish limited liability company, with tax identification number B88524525, duly registered in the Madrid Commercial Register, Volume 39832, Folio 100, Entry 8, Page M707679, and its affiliates (“**GATACA**” or “**we**”) provide decentralized digital identity technology through our website www.gataca.io (“the **Website**”), a backend platform and client applications (collectively “**GATACA Platform**”) and a mobile application called GATACA Wallet (the “**Wallet**”).

The Wallet and its electronic interactions with any products and services provided by GATACA, such as the Website or the GATACA Platform, are referred to here as “the **Service**”.

The Service includes code, images, text, and other materials or third-party content (collectively the “**Contents**”).

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) apply to your access to and use of the Service.

GATACA hereby grants each User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access the Wallet throughout the Terms applicable to such User as it may exist from time to time and to use any systems and/or communications links furnished by GATACA to Users from time to time solely for the purpose of allowing Users, at their election and without obligation, to use the Wallet.

### 4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND USER DATA

GATACA cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.

#### 4.1 DIDs

When setting up an account with GATACA, you acknowledge and consent to the creation of decentralized identifiers (“**DIDs**”) on your behalf. DIDs are a new type of identifiers that enable verifiable, decentralized digital identity.

The Wallet will create on your behalf a root DID and one additional DID per entity or individual you share information with, to serve as alias DID. GATACA publishes DIDs and associated public cryptographic keys on one of the supported blockchain networks to serve as on-chain identifiers. You understand and accept that information on blockchain networks cannot be deleted due to the immutability property of such technologies.

#### 4.2 Cryptographic keys

The GATACA Wallet creates on your behalf one or more cryptographic key pairs for each DID. Cryptographic key pairs are composed of one public key and one private key. The public keys will be linked to your DIDs and published on a designated blockchain network.

The private keys will be used by the Wallet to execute signing and encryption or decryption activities within the Wallet. The private keys are stored in the secure enclave of your device and are only accessible by the Wallet using your biometric information (fingerprint or face ID) enabled by hardware-based device capabilities. You shall have biometric capabilities in your device for the use of the Service.

You agree to (a) keep your private keys confidential and to not share it with anyone else and (b) to not enable biometric information from other individuals in your device where the Wallet is installed.

#### 4.3 Verifiable Credentials

You may (a) download Credentials into your Wallet that contain claims about you and are attested by third-parties, (b) create your own Credentials from the limited set of Credential types offered in the Wallet and (c) share any of the Credentials stored in your Wallet with third parties that have Credential validation capabilities.

GATACA does not have access to, nor collects data about downloaded Credentials attested by Third Parties or self-attested CREDENTIALS THAT ARE NOT VALIDATED BY GATACA. GATACA does not have access to, nor collects data about how Credentials are used or shared with Third Parties.

The email address provided during the registration process is used as a User account identifier. GATACA will store both your email address and Device ID with the sole purpose of providing the Service and sending you communications related to the Service.

GATACA may also issue Credentials containing your mobile phone number information upon your request via the Wallet interface.
