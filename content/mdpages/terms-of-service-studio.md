## 6 Security risks and downtime

GATACA takes security very seriously. GATACA will strive for maximum levels of protection for the Service, by continuously updating the code underlying the Service and incorporating new security measures that account for the risks of such technical advances. Security risks may not be avoided despite our best efforts. As such, GATACA does not guarantee or otherwise warrant security of the Service. By using the Service or accessing the Contents, you acknowledge these inherent risks.

You agree to regularly update the operating system of your device and of any other computing system of the Authorized Users that interact with the Service. GATACA is not responsible for possible damages that may be caused as a consequence of the presence of a virus or an unauthorized use in the computer system used by you, End Users and Authorized Users for the connection to the Service and the Contents.

## 7 Service Levels

GATACA offers Service Level Agreements (“**SLAs**”) for certain subscription tiers. If your subscription includes SLAs, this section will apply.

An Authorized User may raise 3 types of support requests:

* **Incidences**. Request for resolution of system errors or malfunctions
* **Technical doubts**. Request for IT help on topics related to the Service
* **Service requests**. Request for configuration changes, new feature suggestions, or any other modification to the Service or to the Client’s account

Incidences will be classified depending on their severity:

* Level 1 (L1) **Application down**: Production application down or major malfunction affecting business and high number of users
* Level 2 (L2) **Serious Degradation**: Serious degradation of application performance or functionality
* Level 3 (L3) **Moderate Impact**: Application issue that has a moderate impact to the business
* Level 4 (L4) **Low Impact**: Issue with limited business impact

Service performance will be measured based on the following metrics:

· Initial Response Time: amount of time taken for an agent to provide an initial response to a Client request.

· Resolution Time: amount of time between when a Client first creates the request and when such ticket is marked as “resolved”.

· Availability: percentage of time in a given monthly subscription period that the Service is available and accessible for use.

Service levels will be measured averaging the time across all the requests in a monthly subscription period.

If your subscription tier includes SLAs, we commit to the following service levels:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Initial Response Time | Resolution Time | Penalty |
| Incidences | L1: 2 business hours L2: 4 business hours L3: 2 business day L4: 5 business days | L1: 4 business hours L2: 2 business days L3: 5 business hours L4: 20 business days | 5% |
| Technical doubts | 1 business day | 5 business days | - |
| Service requests | 1 business day | - | - |
|  |  |  |  |
| Availability | 99.9% |  | 5% |

If your subscription tier includes SLAs, we agree to credit you an amount equal to 5% of total monthly service fees if any performance metric is not met for incidences on a given monthly subscription period, and 5% if service availability is not met on a given monthly subscription period.

For any other subscription tiers, GATACA will make commercially reasonable efforts to meet similar service level targets.
