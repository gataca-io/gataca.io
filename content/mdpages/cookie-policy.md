Cookies are therefore essential to the functioning of the Site, and in no way constitute a risk to your computer or your device. Moreover, they can help us to identify possible improvements to the Site and to detect website malfunctions.

## 3. TYPE OF COOKIES

Cookies can be classified into different types, according to different criteria:

### 3.1 Types of cookies by the entity that manages them

First-party cookies: those cookies sent to users’ devices from a device or domain managed by the editor of the Site itself and from which the service requested by users is provided.

Analytics or measurement cookies: such cookies allow the cookies manager to perform follow-up and analysis of the user behaviour at the websites to which such cookies are linked; this includes a quantitative measurement of the impact of an advertisement. Any information collected by means of this type of cookies is used to measure activity on any website, application or platform, for the purposes of introducing improvements in function of the analysis of the data regarding the service use made by users.

Advertising Cookies: such cookies allow the management, in the most efficient way possible, of the advertising spaces that, where appropriate, have been included on the Site.
