Functional cookies: such cookies allow you to browse and use the Services.

Analytical cookies: such cookies allow the cookies manager to perform follow-up and analysis of the user behaviour at the Services to which such cookies are linked; this includes a quantitative measurement of the impact of an advertisement. Any information collected by means of this type of cookies is used to measure activity on any website, application or platform, for the purposes of introducing improvements in function of the analysis of the data regarding the Services use made by users.

Advertisement Cookies: such cookies allow the management of the advertising spaces that, where appropriate, have been included on the Services.
